    <h1>Soup Arzu</h1>
    <img src="../images/Screenshot 2022-11-05 173452.png" alt="Soup Arzu">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This soup is very similar to French Onion Soup, the main difference
    being the replacement of beef stock for chicken stock; which happens
    to be our dog, Arzu's, favorite food. During the process of cooking, the
    onion is not fully caramelized, but rather just heated until translucent 
    before adding the stock. The original idea when making this soup actually 
    <i>was</i> to make French Onion Soup, but it ended up being so different 
    that we decided to name it something else altogether.</p>
